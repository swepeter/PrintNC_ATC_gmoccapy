O <tool_offset> SUB

( Filename: tool_offset.ngc )

  #<_probe_offset> = 2.000 ; Define a variable for the probe offset (the distance added to the measured value)
  
  G21 ; Set units to millimeters (G20 would set units to inches)
  M64 P04
  G91 G38.2 F100 Z-5 ; Probe in the negative Z direction up to 20 mm at a feed rate of 300 mm/min, stopping when the probe makes contact
  
  G90 G0 Z[#5063+1] ; Return to absolute mode (G90) and move the Z-axis 1 mm above the contact point stored in parameter #5063
  
  G91 G38.2 F5 Z-1.7 ; Probe slowly in the negative Z direction up to 1.7 mm at a feed rate of 5 mm/min, for a more precise touch-off
  
  G10 L1 P#5400 Z[#5063+#<_probe_offset>] ; Set the current tool's length offset (using G10 L1) with the measured Z position plus the probe offset
  
  G91 G0 Z10 ; Move the Z-axis up 10 mm in relative mode (G91) for clearance after the probing sequence
  M65 P04
